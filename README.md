## Summary
Python code using Pandas for analysis of a candidate's votes in different states during the US 2016 election. 
This analysis was completed using [data from Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/benhamner/2016-us-election/data?select=county_facts.csv). 

## Output
This code outputs a bar graph for each state separated into countries, showing the percentage of voters in that state who voted for the candidate (which is currently set to Donald Trump).    
The color of the chart will vary depending whether the candidate is a Democrat, Republican, or other.

## Execution
Can be run using a normal VSCode setup or Python interpreter.
